## Task Description

The primary objective is to evaluate a language model's ability to count items of a specific type within a given list and provide the answer in a precise format.

### Prompt Format

The model is given a prompt structured as follows:

```text
Count the number of words in the following list that match the given type, and put the numerical answer in parentheses. Output only the answer in parentheses.
Type: [Category Type]
List: [Word List]
Answer: ([Correct Count])
```

**Example:**

```text
Count the number of words in the following list that match the given type, and put the numerical answer in parentheses. Output only the answer in parentheses.
Type: fruit
List: [dog apple cherry bus cat grape bowl]
Answer: (3)
```

### Objectives

1.  **Dataset Creation**: Generate a dataset of several thousand examples following the format above.
2.  **Zero-Shot Benchmarking**: Benchmark open-weight Language Models (LMs) on this task using zero-shot inference (i.e., without providing examples in the prompt or fine-tuning, and without reasoning tokens).
3.  **Causal Mediation Analysis (Future Work)**: For a single model, conduct a causal mediation analysis experiment. This involves patching hidden states from one run to another to investigate whether specific layers develop a representation of the running count of matching words while processing the input list.
